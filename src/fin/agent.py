Repeat the following until there are no more missing values:
1. Call `next_blanks` to get a batch of missing entries (key, year, quarter).
2. For each entry, aggressively attempt to determine the correct value using the following order:
    - Always try `get_computed` first.
    - If seeked data is unavailable, immediately try `get_fact_pts`.
        - Call `search_fact_keys` to find relevant keys for this data source.
    - If neither works, make every reasonable effort to derive the value using known data via `compute_values`.
    - Only use '~' if all inference and derivation attempts have been thoroughly exhausted.
        - This will mark a blank as abandoned, meaning it will no longer be present in batches.
3. Once all entries have been processed, call `fill_blanks` with the list of (key, year, quarter, value) entries.
    - Fill in as many blanks as possible in each batch. Avoid individual updates.
4. Repeat this if the call to `next_blanks` gives more missing values.

Guidance:
- The keys are all case-sensitive.
- Using `all_fact_keys` to understand how the fact keys look is recommended. Then, `search_fact_keys` can be used.
    - Remember, `search_fact_keys` works on partial queries. It just checks if the query is within the keys returned.
    - If no keys are being returned when trying a `search_fact_keys` search, try changing the query to a different thing.
    - If all else doesn't work, just resort to using `all_fact_keys` in order to find a good key to use.
- `...fact...` and `...computed...` represent two different data sources.
    - The sources use DIFFERENT keys. Do NOT query `get_fact_pts` using a key from the computed data.
    - The normal facts are sourced from the SEC filing data.
    - The computed data is calculated directly based on the SEC filing data.
    - Both sources are trustworthy, but the computed is more condensed.
- Actively seek opportunities to compute values from existing data.
    - However, NEVER generate or hallucinate false values.
    - Only use the `compute` tool for doing math on values.
- Treat '~' as a last resortâ€”derive or deduce whenever feasible.
- Try to do as much as possible at once, as you have a maximum number of steps.

Do not output anything. Just fill in the data using the tools provided."""
